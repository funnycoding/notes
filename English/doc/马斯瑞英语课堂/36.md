I've spent some of my childhood years in Honduras.

I gotta say I really miss those years.

So, Honduras is a country located in Central America.

It's home to the very famous Mayan culture, and the official language is Spanish.

Honduran people love music, and they're very outgoing and **enthusiastic**.

Strangers would talk to each other like friends.

I really enjoyed the delicious Honduran food, especially barbecues and fresh seafood, not to mention the soccer culture there.

I remember there were kids playing soccer on almost every street corner.

I also have a lot of photos of me playing soccer there, precious memories.

Unfortunately, after I started going there less, and many of my friends moved to other places, I couldn't play soccer like that anymore.

Man, I really love that country.

I think everybody should be proud of where they come from.

Because to a great extend, your hometown shapes who you are.
