First, you gotta do a little warm-up to keep you from getting hurt.

With my feet shoulder-width apart, I start off with some squats.

From here, get down to the floor and do some push-ups. And it's hard to keep my core tight, but I'm hanging in there.

Next, I do a bench press to work on my chest. Again, you need to stay tight, arch your back a little, and **dig in** with your feet!

Before I finish my workout, I need to do a bit of **stretching** to relax my muscles. Lean into it and breathe in and out.

Okay, I'm done with my workout. And it feels really good, but I'm gonna be really sore tomorrow.

If you really wanna get fit, then you gotta try to keep it up.

Even if it's not COVID-friendly for you to hit the gym, you still can do some easy moves at home.
